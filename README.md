An OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect identity provider with application-scoped, offline-first databases and filesystems.

Applications authenticate through OAuth/OIDC and manage resources in a `(user subject, application)` namespace. Data is stored locally, remains available offline, and synchronizes between approved devices when each peer's Management policy authorizes the selected resource.

## Services

- `idp-service` — OAuth/OIDC, users, clients, tokens, and signing keys.
- `management-service` — applications, permissions, device ownership and approval, resource selection, administrator limits, and sync policy.
- `storage-service` — provides authenticated database and filesystem resource APIs.
- `storage-server` — exposes storage over WebSocket.
- `file-system` — offline-first storage and synchronization.

## Storage

Storage is scoped by `(user subject, application_id)`. Each namespace can own multiple databases and filesystems with distinct stable IDs; display names need not be unique. OAuth clients in the same application share a user's resources. Storage-audience access tokens authorize Storage API actions such as `read` and `write`; they do not authorize peer synchronization. Management owns per-device whole-resource selection and administrator restrictions.

The Storage API provides create, list, get, and delete routes for databases and filesystems. Filesystem sockets use an explicit filesystem ID and a Storage-audience token.

## Offline-first filesystem

`file-system` stores data locally so reads and writes continue without network access.

`file-system` owns filesystem paths, metadata, content, persistence, and synchronization. Full devices retain metadata and content; Passthrough devices retain metadata only, read content from an available selected Full peer, and cannot write. Resource deletion is a tombstone; device deselection removes only that device's local copy.

## Devices

Each installation has a persistent device identity. Devices enroll and pair through `management-service`.

Approved devices synchronize explicitly selected resources peer-to-peer over authenticated Iroh streams. Each peer checks approved endpoint identity, both devices' selections, administrator allowance, and matching resource kind, ID, and namespace. OAuth tokens govern API requests, not mesh synchronization. Revocation blocks new synchronization after policy converges; it cannot erase data already copied offline.

## Applications

Applications use OAuth/OIDC for authentication and the generic storage API for data.

Web, desktop, and mobile clients belonging to the same application can share the same user data while each device remains independently usable offline.

Applications define their own file formats and domain models; device management, peer connections, and synchronization are handled by the underlying services.
